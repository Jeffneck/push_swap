Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple, especially
because from one integers configuration to another, the most efficient sorting algorithm
can differ.

The numbers can be distributed between IN_MIN and INT_MAX.

 the program should adapt the algo used according to respect following guidelines : 
 4 different algos should be used and they have to respect the given complexity index.
    Tiny algo = list of 3 nbs : < 2-3 instructions
    Simple algo = list of 5 nbs : < 12 instructions (aim 8)
    Middle algo = list of 100 nbs : < 700 instructions
    Advanced algo = list of 500 nbs : < 5500 instructions
